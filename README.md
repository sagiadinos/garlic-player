# garlic-player - Open Source SMIL Player for Digital Signage

The garlic-player is a SMIL 3.0 compatible [Digital Signage Player](https://smil-control.com/magazine/what-is-a-digital-signage-player/).

The goal for the development is to create a most as neccessary SMIL 3.0 compatible and as most as possible platform independent free open source multimedia player to meet the needs of the digital signage industry. Currently garlic-player has reached a high level of compatibility and stability. So it is used in many projects and some android hardware solutions.

[Digital Signage](https://smil-control.com/) is a relatively young business and it has a lack of standards. As customer you can easily trapped into a vendor-lock. A standard like SMIL gives you independence back.

The garlic-player can be used offline and online.

Based on [SMIL standard](https://www.w3.org/TR/SMIL3/) it works together with every compatible [Digital Signage Software](https://smil-control.com/software/).

You are able to play local and remote (via http) SMIL files with the features described below.
